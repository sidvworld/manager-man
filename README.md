# Welcome to TaskForce
## This is a proof of concept for this application written in Python

At the beginning of high school, my time management quite frankly sucked and I was in desperate need for a way to keep my tasks in order. After countless scrolling through the microsoft app store for an efficient task manager, I found that none these apps truly worked for me as they were tedious and ineffective.

TaskForce was created to solve my problems, and one it's most useful features provides a way to integrate your task management into your workflow.
